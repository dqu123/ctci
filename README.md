# Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) Solutions
## David Qu, Caltech CS 2017

This repo contains David's C++ solutions to various CTCI (4th edition) problems.

### Makefile
Solution programs are named X.Y.cc where X denotes the chapter and Y denotes the problem number of CTCI. <br>

### Testing
All programs use the ```test.h``` module.
Each program runs through test cases that pipe the result to ```std::cerr```. <br>
The ```-i``` flag makes the program interactive and allows the user to input test cases dynamically.
